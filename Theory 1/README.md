## Theory Assignment 1

1. Summarise booting process of 
    - (1) Windows and
    - (2) Linux operating system 
    
    through a flow-chart/diagram/algorithm notation/step-by-step description in brief. 
    <br> Do specify the version of operating system referenced by you.

2. Discuss in brief:
- Program versus process
- Virtual address space versus physical address space of a process
- Device controller versus device driver
- Kernel mode versus User mode

3. Learn about following unix/linux commands (you should execute these on your machine with more commonly used options. For examples: ls with -a option can be used for listing hidden files as well.)
- **Directory related**:   pwd, cd,  rmdir, ls (with options -a, -l), find, tree, zip, tar 
- **File related**:  cp, rm, mv, chmod, chown, chgrp, cat, top, grep, ln, tail, diff, sort, locate
- **User related**: sudo, su, whoami, finger, who
- **Process related**:  pid, ppid, fork, exec, ps, top, kill
- **Disk related**:  df, du, format, free, mount
- **Network related**: ssh, sftp, ifconfig, ping, traceback, iptables,  
- **Others**:  whereis, man, more, less, top, touch, date, passwd, export, shutdown, echo, clear, service, whatis, uname, alias, history, apt-get/yum 
- **Joining linux commands** using  Pipe ( | ),   redirect ( > )
